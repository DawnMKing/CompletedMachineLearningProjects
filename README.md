# CompletedMachineLearningProjects
Machine Learning Projects for the completion of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. Each project contians an html file for easy viewing of the project, the jupyter ipy notebook used to edit the project for submission, and Python code. Description of each follows:

## Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Purpose is to predict boston housing prices based on 490 data points and 3 features. 
**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-student ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

###Key Highlights

Supervised Learning: Decision Tree Regressor

**Learned Performance:**
*Learning Curves* show high bias when tree depth is too low, and high variance when tree depth is to high.
